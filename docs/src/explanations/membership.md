# Membership: degrees of belonging

Membership functions determine a *degree of truth*.

Fuzzy set $A$, $A = \{x, μ_A(x) | x ∈ X$\}, where $X$ is the universe of discourse.

A larger value means a greater grade of membership. Zero means "not a member" while one means "full member".

* **Support**: Points where $μ_A > 0$
* **Crossover**: The point where $μ_A > 0.5$
* **Core**: Points where $μ_A = 1$
