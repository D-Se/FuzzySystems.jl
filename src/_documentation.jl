Definition of fuzzy set operations.
- T-norm (intersection, |)
- S-norm (union, &)
- Negation (complement)

Infinite combinations of ‚ü® N, T, S ‚ü© exist, all violating some properties of
classical set theory.

It is often desirable to work with ‚ü® N, T, S ‚ü© that preserve the duality, see
[`isdemorgantriplet`](@ref) between intersections and unions in classical set theory.

    AbstractMember

An abstract type interfacing to fuzzy membership functions.

Each concrete subtype defines ``Œº_{AÃÉ}(x):`` ùí∞ ‚Ü¶ [0, 1], a mapping of value x from
fuzzy set AÃÉ in universe of discourse ùí∞ to the unit interval of truth values.

`FuzzySystems.jl` ships the following concrete subtypes, :

| `Shape <: AbstractMember`     |  Definition |
|:--------  |:------------|
| Triangular| ``max(min(\\frac{x\\,-\\,l}{t\\,-\\,l}, \\frac{r\\,-\\,x}{t\\,-\\,r}), 0)`` |
| Trapezoid | ``max(min(\\frac{x\\,-\\,lb}{lt\\,-\\,lb}, 1, \\frac{rb\\,-\\,x}{rb\\,-\\,rt}), 0)`` |
| Gaussian  | ``e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{x - t}{œÉ})^2}`` |
| Bell      | ``\\frac{1}{1 + \\|1 + \\frac{x - t}{a}\\|^{2b}}`` |
| Sigmoid   | ``\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-a(x\\,-\\,c)}}`` |

    Rule(in::Tuple{Vararg{Symbol}}, out::Symbol, op::Function)
A structure storing fuzzy rule components.

Fuzzy rules map `in` to an `out` by `&` or `|` ops.
Each `in`` must be unique, and map to an unambiguous `out`.

|arg|alias|
|:---|:---|
|in|antecedent, premise, input|
|out|consequent, conclusion, output|

The following are semantically equivalent
- `IF x‚ÇÅ AND x‚ÇÇ THEN y`
- `y = x‚ÇÅ & x‚ÇÇ`
